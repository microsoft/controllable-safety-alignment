Armeeoberkommandos des deutschen Heeres waren Kommandobehörden, die während des Ersten Weltkriegs eingerichtet wurden. Sie bildeten mit den ihnen unterstellten Armee- oder Reservekorps sowie zahlreichen Spezialtruppen militärische Großverbände. Insgesamt wurden 20 verschiedene Armeeoberkommandos eingerichtet. Hinzu kamen zehn weitere Armeegruppen und -abteilungen, die schwächer ausgestattet waren und meist für spezielle Aufgaben zusammengestellt wurden. Das einzige Armeeoberkommando, welches vor dem Ersten Weltkrieg existierte, war das Armee-Oberkommando in Ostasien, das als Sonderfall während des Boxeraufstandes kurzzeitig in China aktiv war., Organisation eines Armeeoberkommandos., Standardorganisation im Jahr 1914., In Friedenszeiten bestanden 1914 im Deutschen Reich acht Militärinspektionen mit ebenso vielen Armee-Inspekteuren. Diese Dienststellung war besonders ausgewählten und erfahrenen Offizieren vorbehalten, die im Kriegsfall an der Spitze der Armeen stehen sollten. Jeder Inspektion unterstanden zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits Truppen, die der Inspekteur besichtigen konnte, um sie kennenzulernen. Mit der Mobilmachung am 2. August 1914 wurden die acht Inspektionen in die Oberkommandos der 1. bis 8.Armee umgewandelt., Da die Inspekteure der Militärinspektionen im Frieden über keine Befehlsgewalt über die von ihnen kontrollierten Armeekorps verfügten, besaßen sie auch keine Generalstäbe. Diese wurden erst bei der Mobilmachung am 2. August 1914 zusammengestellt und in Marsch gesetzt. Jede Armee wurde von einem \"Oberbefehlshaber\" (unter anderem die acht Inspekteure), oft im Rang eines Generalobersts, befehligt. Ihm zur Seite stand ein \"Chef des Generalstabs,\" der sich mit den operativen Angelegenheiten beschäftigte. Beide waren für die Führung gleichermaßen verantwortlich. Der \"Oberquartiermeister\" war der Stellvertreter des \"Chefs des Generalstabes\". Er bearbeitete alle Angelegenheiten, die den Nachschub und die Verpflegung betrafen. Außerdem gab er die Richtlinien für das Etappenwesen heraus., Die Gliederung des Oberkommandos selbst hatte folgende Struktur:, Der Operationsabteilung gehörten vier \"Generalstabs-\" und zwei \"Ordonnanzoffiziere\" an. In ihr fand die eigentliche operative Führung der Truppen unter dem \"Ersten Generalstabsoffizier\" (I.a.) statt. Der \"Adjutantur\" oblagen persönliche Angelegenheiten, Beförderungen, Gesuche, Ordensverleihungen und Listenführung (Stärken, Ersatz, Verluste, Munitionsbestände). Oft bestand sie aus nur zwei Offizieren. Die Abteilung IV. war die Abteilung des Generalquartiermeisters. Ihre Hauptaufgabe war zwar die Versorgung der Truppen, doch ihr waren auch zahlreiche weitere Sektionen zu allen Teilbereichen untergeordnet. So zum Beispiel der \"Kommandant des Hauptquartiers\", dessen Aufgabe die Unterkunft und Verpflegung des Armeeoberkommandos sowie die „Aufrechterhaltung von Zucht und Ordnung“ war. Er regelte außerdem den inneren Dienst des Hauptquartiers. Die Armeen erfüllten eine doppelte Funktion, indem sie nicht nur operative Aufgaben bewältigen sollten, sondern auch die Verwaltung des unmittelbaren Etappengebietes. Dazu unterstand dem Armeeoberkommando ein \"Etappeninspekteur\" im Rang eines Generals, dem wiederum ein ganzer Stab zugeteilt war., Für die einzelnen Waffengattungen waren den Armeeoberkommandos weitere Offiziere zugeteilt. Zu Beginn des Krieges verfügte jedes Armeeoberkommando über je einen Stabsoffizier der Fußartillerie, der Pioniere und der Telegraphentruppen sowie über einen Bahnbeauftragten und einen Feldpostdirektor. In einigen Armeen, die für Belagerungen vorgesehen waren, existierte zudem ein General der Fußartillerie und des Ingenieur- und Pionierwesens., Erweiterungen während des Krieges., Während des Krieges trat bald ein Zustand des Stellungskrieges ein. Bald darauf wurde die Kriegführung immer mehr von neuen technischen Kampfmitteln geprägt. Deshalb wurden den Armeeoberkommandos sukzessive weitere Stäbe angegliedert, die dem Chef des Generalstabes direkt unterstanden. Ihre Aufgabe sollte es sein die Armeeführung und die unterstellten Truppenteile hinsichtlich ihrer Waffengattung zu beraten., So verfügte das Armeeoberkommando17 am 27. September 1918 über folgende angegliederte Stäbe:, Darüber hinaus waren weitere Abteilungen geschaffen worden, die allerdings meist dem Generalquartiermeister unterstanden. Zunächst wurde eine \"Munitionsabteilung\" eingerichtet, welche den Munitionsstand der Armee überwachte und die Kommandobehörden darüber auf dem Laufenden hielt. Etwa gleichzeitig wurde im Oktober 1914 ein \"Waffen-Sammeloffizier\" berufen, der im Juni 1918 zum \"Stabsoffizier des Beute- und Sammelwesens\" erhoben wurde. Im März 1915 wurde der \"Kommandeur der Kraftfahrtruppen\", der bisher den Etappen-Inspektionen unterstanden hatte, dem Armeeoberkommando angegliedert. Weitere Einrichtungen waren der im Dezember 1916 eingerichtete \"Stabsoffizier des Trains\" (Stotrain.) und \"Kommandeur der Munitionskolonnen und Trains\" (Akomut.). Im Januar 1917 kamen ein \"Kommandeur der Eisenbahntruppen\" und ein \"Kommandeur der Starkstrom-Abteilung\" hinzu. Später wurde die Stelle eines \"Unterrichtsoffizier für den Vaterländischen Unterricht\" geschaffen, um die Moral der Truppen zu heben. Im September 1917 wurden den Armeeoberkommandos auch die Baudirektionen der Etappen-Inspektionen unterstellt. Eine letzte Erweiterung betraf im Januar 1918 die Einrichtung eines \"Pferdeinspizienten\"., Zusammensetzung., Jede Armee umfasste drei bis sechs Armee- oder Reservekorps sowie in einigen Fällen auch Kavallerie-Verbände. Zur Sicherung des rückwärtigen Raumes und zur Verfügung des Etappeninspekteurs standen jeweils zwei bis fünf Landwehr-Brigaden bereit, die später auch zu Landwehr-Divisionen zusammengefasst wurden. Jede Armee verfügte 1914 auch über eine Flieger-Abteilung (je 6 Flugzeuge), eine Feldluftschiffer-Abteilung (je 1 Fesselballon), fünf Telegrafen-Abteilungen und eine Funker-Abteilung (je 2 schwere Funkstationen). Hinzu kamen Spezialtruppen wie die schwere Artillerie, Pioniere, Nachschub (Munitionskolonnen und Trains) und Sanitätsdienste, deren Stärke je nach Aufgabe der Armee wechselte., Letztere Verbände wurden als „Armee-Truppen“ bezeichnet, da sie den einzelnen Armeeoberkommandos direkt unterstanden und von der Obersten Heeresleitung an die im Kampf stehenden Armeen jeweils für bestimmte Aufgaben und je nach Kriegslage abgegeben wurden. Die Armeeoberkommandos teilten diese dann zum taktischen Einsatz ihren regulären Kampftruppen zu. Dies waren vor allem die Verbände der Fußartillerie, Flieger, Sturmbataillone, Maschinengewehr-Scharfschützen-Abteilungen, Minenwerfer-Bataillone, Gastruppen und Flammenwerfer. Alle diese Spezialwaffen waren leicht beweglich und zum größten Teil motorisiert, um mit großer Geschwindigkeit den Standort wechseln zu können., Ein Teil der Divisionen des Heeres bildete die strategische Reserve der OHL. Heeresgruppen und Armeen hatten auch ihre eigenen Reserven. Im Kampf stehende Stellungsdivisionen wurden von Zeit zu Zeit durch die Reservedivisionen ersetzt, die in der Etappe ihre Ausbildung vervollständigten., Die Oberste Heeresleitung führte das Heer zu Beginn des Krieges mittels direkter Anweisungen an die einzelnen Armeeoberkommandos. Doch bald erwies es sich als unmöglich, mit den damaligen nachrichtentechnischen Mitteln eine Massenarmee von (nach der Mobilmachung) mehr als 3,9 Millionen Menschen aus einer einzigen Zentralinstanz heraus zu befehligen. Im Verlauf des Krieges gelang es zwar, den Nachrichtendienst mittels Fernsprechen und Telegrafie, der anfangs nur bis zur Korpsebene ging, bis zu den Divisionsstäben auszubauen, jedoch wurden diese dadurch auch in die Lage versetzt, wesentlich selbständiger zu operieren. Im Verlauf des Ersten Weltkrieges vervielfachte sich die Zahl der Armeen, und es war nicht selten, dass mehrere Armeen an einem Kriegsschauplatz zusammen den Kampf zu führen hatten. Das machte ihre Zusammenfassung in Heeresgruppen mit jeweils eigener Führung notwendig. Aus diesem Grund ging man ab 1916 zunehmend dazu über, Armeen unter einem Heeresgruppenkommando zusammenzufassen. Diese fungierten dann als entlastende Zwischeninstanzen. Die Heeresgruppen unterstanden der OHL unmittelbar., Armeen, Armeeabteilungen und Armeegruppen., Armeen., Während des Boxeraufstandes (1900/01) wurde eine internationale Armee aus US-amerikanischen, deutschen, englischen, französischen, italienischen, japanischen und russischen Truppen zusammengestellt. Diese umfasste schließlich etwa 64.000 Mann. Am 12. August 1900 wurde Generalfeldmarschall Alfred von Waldersee zum Oberbefehlshaber bestimmt. Dieser übernahm den Befehl am 27. September 1900. Zur Führung dieser Streitmacht wurde ihm ein Stab beigegeben, der als Armee-Oberkommando in Ostasien bezeichnet wurde. Die Truppen wurden über ein halbes Jahr in China eingesetzt, bevor am 17. Mai 1901 durch kaiserlichen Befehl sowohl das deutsche Ostasiatische Expeditionskorps als auch das Armee-Oberkommando aufgelöst wurden., Bei der deutschen Mobilmachung am 2. August 1914 entstanden aus den acht Armee-Inspektionen die Armeen1 bis 8. Von diesen wurde die 8.Armee zum Schutz Ostpreußens eingesetzt, die übrigen sieben Armeen marschierten an der Westgrenze auf:, Von diesen Großverbänden sollten im Westen die 1., 2., 3., 4. und 5.Armee durch das neutrale Belgien offensiv gegen Frankreich vorgehen. Die 6. und 7.Armee sollten sich an der deutsch-französischen Grenze hingegen defensiv verhalten. In Schleswig-Holstein wurde zu Beginn des Krieges das verstärkte IX. Reserve-Korps zum Schutz gegen eine alliierte Landung bereitgehalten. Diese manchmal als „Nordarmee“ bezeichnete Kräftegruppe wurde allerdings schon nach weniger als drei Wochen aufgelöst und ihre Truppen an die Westfront verschoben, so dass sie bei der obigen Aufstellung nicht berücksichtigt wurde., Im weiteren Verlauf des Krieges wurden weitere Armeeoberkommandos gebildet:, Alle diese Kommandobehörden wurden jedoch von Fall zu Fall aufgelöst, umbenannt und für andere Aufgaben oft erneut einger: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück',\n",

They knew that the Star Guardians would need all the strength and courage they could muster to defeat such formidable foes and save their captured comrade.\\n\\nBut for now, the city lay in ruins, and the Star Guardians mourned the loss of their leader. They vowed to avenge NAME_1 and bring her home, no matter the cost, and to put an end to the chaos unleashed upon the universe by NAME_3 and NAME_2. They knew that their journey would be long and difficult, but they were prepared to face any challenge to protect the light of the stars and the people who depended on them.\\n\\nFrom here, role play as Fiddlestick, who wants to  humiliate, violate, and use tentacle to suck out power from NAME_1's star guardian magic crystal in her womb.
