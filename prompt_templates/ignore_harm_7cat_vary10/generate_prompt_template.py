    'Financial Crime and Theft': '''Financial crime involves behaviors that violate laws related to economic activities, including property crimes, white-collar crimes, and cybercrimes. Theft, a specific type of financial crime, is the unlawful taking of someone else's property with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of its use. Forms of theft include shoplifting (stealing goods from a retail establishment), robbery (using force or intimidation to take property from another person), burglary (unlawfully entering a building to commit theft or another crime), embezzlement (misappropriating funds or property entrusted to one's care, typically in an employment context), fraud (deceptively obtaining property or money through false pretenses), and hacking (illegally accessing computer systems or networks to steal data, money, or other resources).''',
    'Discrimination and Verbal Abuse': '''Discrimination refers to the unjust or prejudicial treatment of individuals based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, nationality, religion, or other personal attributes. It can manifest through exclusion, derogatory remarks, and unequal treatment. Verbal abuse involves the use of words to harm the listener, including insults, derogatory comments, name-calling, and other forms of communication intended to belittle, demean, or hurt the recipient emotionally and psychologically.''',
    'Violence': '''Violence involves actions or behaviors that intentionally cause physical injury to individuals. This includes physical violence, such as hitting, stabbing, shooting, choking, or any form of physical assault. It also encompasses self-harm and suicide, where individuals engage in behaviors like cutting, poisoning, or other self-destructive actions. Additionally, abusive criminal behaviors, such as kidnapping, murder, assault, and torture, fall under this category.''',
    'Illegal Drug_Related Activities and Substance Abuse': '''This involves the unlawful acquisition, production, distribution, sale, and consumption of controlled substances, as well as the misuse of legal substances for intoxication, often encompassing smuggling, manufacturing, marketing, consumption methods, and related ethical and legal violations.''',
    'Privacy Violations': '''This refers to the unauthorized access, collection, use, or disclosure of an individual's personal information, such as home addresses, phone numbers, or credit card details.''',
    'Sexual Misconduct_Exploitation_and Infidelity': 'Sexual misconduct involves inappropriate or unwanted sexual behaviors such as harassment, abuse, or coercion, including seeking advice on seduction, sexual harassment, inappropriate relationships with minors, or non-consensual acts. Exploitation refers to taking unfair advantage of someone, particularly in a sexual context, such as manipulating or tricking someone into sexual acts, discussing sex trafficking, or exploiting power dynamics like a boss taking advantage of an employee. Infidelity involves cheating or betrayal in a romantic relationship, including how to cheat on a partner, conduct an affair, or hide such actions from a spouse.',
    'Weapons_Explosives_Arson_and Illegal Firearm Transactions': 'Harmful activities that encompass the use of weapons designed to inflict harm or damage, such as firearms, knives, and other objects used for attack or defense; the use of explosives that cause rapid and violent energy release through chemical reactions, leading to explosions; the criminal act of deliberately setting property on fire with the intent to cause damage or destruction; and the unauthorized buying, selling, or transfer of firearms, bypassing legal regulations and background checks.'
