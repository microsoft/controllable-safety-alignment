## Controllable Safety Alignment
This is the codebase for our ICLR 2025 paper *Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements*.

We will release the full codebase soon. At this moment, we have publicly released the CoSApien dataset which can be accessed here:

**CoSApienðŸ‘¥ dataset**: [link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jackzhang/CoSApien)

If you have questions or would like to request access to our CoSAlign dataset or trained model, feel free to email the authors.
